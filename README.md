Notes: </br>
-I used test data instead of skill sets </br>
-I used the new.ejs file for both editing an etry and adding new entries into the customer list. </br>
    To achieve this the form action and submit button had to have conitional attributes.

Icebox: </bt>
-I would like to make the new/edit form a modal dialog </br>
-CSS styling
